            Cats are lovely animals! Adult cats typically weigh 4â€“6 kg. Cats have excellent night vision and can see at only
            one-sixth the light level required for human vision. The domestic cat's hearing is most acute in the range of
            500 Hz to 32 kHz. Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be slightly more active at
            night. Cats use many vocalizations for communication: purring, hissing, trilling, grunting, and several
            different forms of meowing.
